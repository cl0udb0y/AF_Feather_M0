# AF_Feather_M0
Used to test transmission on an Adafruit M0 Feather (SAMD) board https://www.adafruit.com/products/3177
Using LowPowerLab library https://github.com/LowPowerLab/RFM69/
When compiling you will need to move the RFM69_OTA and RMF69_ATA from the Library to compile as the SAMD board throws exceptions if present.
